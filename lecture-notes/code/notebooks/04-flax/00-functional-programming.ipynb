    "## Introduction: Why are we here?\n",
    "Before diving into Flax and JAX, we must shift our mental model. Most of us are trained \n",
    "in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, where we bundle data and logic together into \"objects.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, modern Machine Learning (ML) frameworks, specifically JAX, rely \n",
    "heavily on **Functional Programming (FP)**. If you try to write JAX code using standard\n",
    " OOP habits, you will fight the framework at every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will clarify the difference between these two paradigms and explain \n",
    "*why* FP is the preferred choice for high-performance scientific computing.\n",

    "## The Two Mental Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The OOP Model: \"Stateful Objects\"\n",
    "In OOP, objects encapsulate state (variables) and behavior (methods). \n",
    "When you call a method, the object often changes internally. This is called a **Side Effect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Analogy:** A car's odometer. You drive the car (method), and the mileage counter \n",
    "updates (internal state change). You don't need to manually calculate the new mileage; \n",
    "the car \"remembers\" it.\n",
    "* **The Trap:** If you run a function twice, you might get different results because \n",
    "the internal state has changed. This makes debugging physics simulations or distributed \n",
    "training loops difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Functional Model: \"Pure Functions\"\n",
    "In FP, data and behavior are strictly separated.\n",
    "1.  **Pure Functions:** A function's output depends *only* on its input. \n",
    "It has no memory of history. $f(x)$ is always $y$.\n",
    "2.  **Immutability:** We do not modify variables in place. Instead, we generate \n",
    "*new* variables representing the updated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Analogy:** A physics equation. $Position(t)$ gives you the location at time $t$. \n",
    "The equation doesn't \"change\" the universe; it simply describes a value based on inputs.\n"

    "\n",
    "In the OOP StatefulCounter example, the method `increment()` takes zero arguments \n",
    "but produces different outputs every time you call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "counter.increment() # Returns 1\n",
    "counter.increment() # Returns 2\n",
    "counter.increment() # Returns 3\n",

    "Scientific Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The \"Hidden State\" Trap\n",
    "\n",
    "In the OOP version, the output depends on a variable (`self.count`) that lives inside \n",
    "the object. \n",
    "To understand what `counter.increment()` will return, you have to know exactly how \n",
    "many times it was called previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Scientific Issue:* Imagine you are running a physics simulation or training a \n",
    "neural network in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You run the cell that updates the weights once. The loss goes down.\n",
    "\n",
    "You accidentally run the cell again (or run cells out of order). The weights update again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model state is now different from what you think it is, and you cannot reproduce \n",
    "that specific result without restarting the kernel and running everything in exact order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purity and Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "In math and science, we expect functions to be Pure. If we define a function $f(x)=x+1$ , \n",
    "then $f(2)$ is always $3$. It doesn't matter if it's Tuesday, or if you calculated $f(100)$ \n",
    "five minutes ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OOP (Impure)**: `increment()` acts like a function where `f()` changes every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FP (Pure)**: `increment(2)` is always `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parallelization (The \"Race Condition\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific ML requires massive parallelization (running on thousands of GPU cores).\n",
    "\n",
    "*OOP*: If two different GPU cores try to run `counter.increment()` on the same object \n",
    "at the same time, they might fight over `self.count` (a race condition). You might end \n",
    "up with `1` when you expected `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*FP*: Since `increment(count)` creates a new value rather than modifying the old one, \n",
    "it is safe to run on a million cores simultaneously without them interfering with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "When the result depends on history (implicit state), you lose determinism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OOP**: \"Update the world.\" (Easier to write, harder to debug/parallelize).\n",
    "\n",
    "**FP**: \"Given the world as it is now, calculate the next world.\""
